## Functionality

- The user can start the study timer
- Once the timer ends the user will be sent to the break screen where the break will begin


## Known Issues
- none so far

## Future Functionality
- Currently Lo-Fi music does not play as the spotify api requires a premium account which I do not have
- Ability for user to define their own break and study duration
